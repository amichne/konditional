# Getting Started

If you are new to Konditional, this section gets you to your first safe feature toggle quickly.

In this section you will find:

- [Installation](/quickstart/install) - add core + runtime dependencies
- [Your First Feature](/quickstart/define-first-flag) - define, evaluate, and verify one feature end-to-end

---

## 10-minute outcome

By the end of this path, you will have:

- a typed feature defined in a namespace
- a deterministic evaluation call in application code
- a basic verification check proving expected behavior
