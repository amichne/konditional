description: Legacy path for rule composition guidance.

This legacy page preserves an old URL and points to the canonical rule
composition documentation.

## Read this page when

- You arrived from an older link or bookmark.
- You need current guidance for composing rules and rule sets.
- You need the modern evaluation-order model.

## Steps in scope

1. Use [Rule DSL](/core/rules/) for composition constructs and targeting
   primitives.
2. Use [Evaluation model](/learn/evaluation-model/) for ordering and fallback
   semantics.
3. Use [Core DSL best practices](/core/best-practices) for maintainable
   composition patterns.

- [Core DSL best practices](/core/best-practices)
- [Determinism proofs](/theory/determinism-proofs)

## Next steps

1. Update internal links to canonical routes.
2. Validate composition behavior in deterministic tests.
3. Remove legacy references when migration completes.
