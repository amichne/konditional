title: Rollout Strategies (Legacy)
description: Legacy path for rollout strategy guidance.

This legacy page preserves an old URL and points to the canonical rollout
guidance.

## Read this page when

- You arrived from an older link or bookmark.
- You need current guidance for staged rollouts.
- You need deterministic bucketing details.

## Steps in scope

1. Use [Rolling out gradually](/how-to-guides/rolling-out-gradually/) for
   practical rollout execution.
2. Use [Ramp-up bucketing](/reference/api/ramp-up-bucketing/) for hashing and
   bucket semantics.
3. Use [Determinism proofs](/theory/determinism-proofs) for canonical
   guarantees.

- [Determinism proofs](/theory/determinism-proofs)

## Next steps

1. Update internal links to canonical routes.
2. Add rollout tests for deterministic cohort behavior.
3. Remove legacy references when migration completes.
