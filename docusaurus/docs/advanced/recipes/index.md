# Recipes: Best-Practice Patterns

Practical patterns for real-world feature control using only Konditional building blocks. Each recipe highlights a supported solution area and makes the guarantee boundaries explicit.

Covered solution areas:
- Typed features (booleans, enums, structured values)
- Deterministic rollouts and salting
- Axes and custom context targeting
- Remote configuration (snapshot/patch boundary + rollback)
- Shadow evaluation for safe migrations
- Namespace isolation and kill-switch
- Observability hooks (logging + metrics)
