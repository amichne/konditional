# Konditional Core
import GuaranteeBlock from '@site/src/components/GuaranteeBlock';


Type-safe, deterministic feature flags for Kotlin.

Konditional Core is the smallest surface you need to define and evaluate features in code. You write features as typed
properties, pass a Context at runtime, and always get a value back.

## Start here

- [Installation](/getting-started/installation)
- [Your First Feature](/getting-started/your-first-flag)
- [Core Concepts](/fundamentals/core-primitives)
- [Evaluation Model](/fundamentals/evaluation-semantics)

## Quick example

```kotlin
import io.amichne.konditional.context.*
import io.amichne.konditional.core.dsl.enable

object AppFeatures : Namespace("app") {
    val darkMode by boolean<Context>(default = false) {
        enable { ios() }
        enable { rampUp { 10.0 } }
    }
}

val ctx = Context(
    locale = AppLocale.UNITED_STATES,
    platform = Platform.IOS,
    appVersion = Version.of(2, 0, 0),
    stableId = StableId.of("user-123"),
)

val enabled: Boolean = AppFeatures.darkMode.evaluate(ctx)
```

## Guarantees in core

### Type-safe access

<GuaranteeBlock
  label="Type-safe access"
  guarantee="Feature access and return types are compile-time safe for statically-defined features."
  mechanism="Property delegation and generic type propagation on `Feature<T, Context, Namespace>`."
  boundary="This does not apply to dynamically-generated features or external configuration systems."
/>

### Total evaluation

<GuaranteeBlock
  label="Total evaluation"
  guarantee={`Every evaluation returns a value of the declared type; no nulls and no missing cases.`}
  mechanism={`Each feature requires a \`default\` value, which is returned when no rule matches.`}
  boundary={`If your business logic is wrong, Konditional still returns a value; correctness is your responsibility.`}
/>

### Deterministic ramp-ups

<GuaranteeBlock
  label="Deterministic ramp-ups"
  guarantee={`The same \`(stableId, featureKey, salt)\` always yields the same bucket assignment.`}
  mechanism={`SHA-256 bucketing reduces the hash to a stable integer in \`[0, 9999]\`.`}
  boundary={`Changing any of \`stableId\`, \`featureKey\`, or \`salt\` changes the bucket assignment.`}
/>

- [Atomicity guarantees](/theory/atomicity-guarantees)

## What Konditional Core does not include

Konditional Core does not ship remote configuration, JSON serialization, or observability helpers. Those live in
separate modules:

- [Runtime](/runtime/)
- [Serialization](/serialization/)
- [Observability](/observability/)
