# Parse, don't validate (legacy bridge)

This legacy theory page now points to canonical pages for boundary-safe snapshot
ingestion and typed failure handling.

## Read this page when

- You followed an old design-theory parse link.
- You need maintained guidance on boundary-safe ingestion.
- You want implementation-first docs tied to parsing behavior.

## Canonical pages

Use [Why typed flags](/overview/why-typed-flags) and
[Load first snapshot safely](/quickstart/load-first-snapshot-safely).

## Next steps

1. Review boundary model in [Why typed flags](/overview/why-typed-flags).
2. Implement loading with
   [Load first snapshot safely](/quickstart/load-first-snapshot-safely).
3. Verify failures with [Verify end-to-end](/quickstart/verify-end-to-end).
