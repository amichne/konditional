# Roll out gradually (legacy bridge)

This legacy rollout page now points to the canonical ramp-up quickstart step.

## Read this page when

- You followed an old rollout guide URL.
- You need maintained deterministic ramp-up instructions.
- You are updating internal links to canonical docs.

## Canonical page

Use [Add deterministic ramp-up](/quickstart/add-deterministic-ramp-up).

## Next steps

1. Configure rollout in
   [Add deterministic ramp-up](/quickstart/add-deterministic-ramp-up).
2. Verify cohort behavior with [Verify end-to-end](/quickstart/verify-end-to-end).
3. Plan phased rollout in [Adoption roadmap](/overview/adoption-roadmap).
