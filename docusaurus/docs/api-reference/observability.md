title: Observability API (Legacy)
description: Legacy route that bridges to canonical observability reference pages.
unlisted: true
---

This legacy page is kept for link compatibility. The canonical observability API
reference now lives under `/observability/reference`.

## Read this page when

- You followed an older bookmark under `/api-reference`.
- You need the canonical observability API pages after a route migration.

## Deterministic API and contract notes

- This bridge page defines no runtime API behavior.
- Contract guarantees are defined only in the canonical reference pages.
- Route preservation is deterministic: this path always points to the same
  canonical observability docs.

## Canonical conceptual pages

- [Theory: Migration and shadowing](/theory/migration-and-shadowing)
- [Theory: Atomicity guarantees](/theory/atomicity-guarantees)

## Next steps

- [Observability reference](/observability/reference)
- [Shadow evaluation reference](/observability/shadow-evaluation)
- [OpenTelemetry reference](/opentelemetry/reference)
