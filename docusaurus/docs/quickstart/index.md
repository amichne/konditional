# Quickstart

This quickstart walks you through a deterministic first implementation from
dependency setup to end-to-end verification.

## Read this page when

- You are ready to implement Konditional in code.
- You need a strict, non-duplicating sequence of setup steps.
- You want one verifiable path before broader adoption.

## Outcome

By the end, you will have one typed feature defined, evaluated in app code,
rolled out with deterministic ramp-up, loaded through a boundary-safe snapshot
API, and verified end to end [CLM-PR01-06A].

## Steps

1. [Install](/quickstart/install)
2. [Define first flag](/quickstart/define-first-flag)
3. [Evaluate in app code](/quickstart/evaluate-in-app-code)
4. [Add deterministic ramp-up](/quickstart/add-deterministic-ramp-up)
5. [Load first snapshot safely](/quickstart/load-first-snapshot-safely)
6. [Verify end-to-end](/quickstart/verify-end-to-end)

## Next steps

1. Start with [Install](/quickstart/install).
2. Complete [Define first flag](/quickstart/define-first-flag) and
   [Evaluate in app code](/quickstart/evaluate-in-app-code).
3. Finish by running [Verify end-to-end](/quickstart/verify-end-to-end).
