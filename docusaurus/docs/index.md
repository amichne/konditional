# Konditional docs

Konditional docs are organized as a progressive path from decision making to
first working rollout to operational adoption.

## Read this page when

- You need the fastest path to the right documentation track.
- You want a non-duplicating map of canonical docs.
- You are migrating from legacy docs URLs.

## Canonical documentation path

Start with `overview/*` to decide fit and understand guarantees, then move to
`quickstart/*` to implement and verify one end-to-end flow.

- `overview/*`: product fit, typed model, first-success plan, phased adoption.
- `quickstart/*`: install, define, evaluate, ramp, load, verify.
- Legacy locations (`getting-started/*`, `guides/*`, `design-theory/*`,
  `quick-start/*`) now bridge to canonical pages.

## Suggested reading order

1. [Start here](/overview/start-here)
2. [Product value and fit](/overview/product-value-fit)
3. [Why typed flags](/overview/why-typed-flags)
4. [First success map](/overview/first-success-map)
5. [Quickstart](/quickstart/)

## Next steps

1. Begin with [Start here](/overview/start-here).
2. Build your first implementation with [Quickstart](/quickstart/).
3. Plan rollout operations with [Adoption roadmap](/overview/adoption-roadmap).
