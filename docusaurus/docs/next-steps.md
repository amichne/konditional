# Next Steps / Deep Dives

This documentation set focuses on `:konditional-core`: the DSL + evaluation engine.

When you’re ready to operate Konditional in a real system, the next modules to understand are:

- `:konditional-runtime` — configuration lifecycle (loading, rollback, and operational surfaces)
- `:konditional-serialization` — boundary codecs (snapshots/patches) and their typed failure models
- `:konditional-observability` — higher-level observability patterns (including shadow evaluation)
- `:opentelemetry` — vendor integration (if you need standardized telemetry pipelines)

If you want copy/paste patterns before deep dives, start with [Recipes](recipes).
