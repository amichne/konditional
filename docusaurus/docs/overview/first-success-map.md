# First success map

Use this decision page to pick the fastest path for your current goal.

## What you will achieve

You will:

- choose one path with clear scope and validation;
- avoid reading unrelated deep-dive content too early.

## Prerequisites

You need to know your immediate goal: evaluation, rollout, remote config, or
migration.

## Main content

Choose one path and complete it before moving to advanced topics.

## Path chooser

1. **Goal: Ship one typed flag in code**
   - Start: [Quickstart](/quickstart/)
   - Stop condition: one feature evaluates deterministically in your app.

2. **Goal: Load remote configuration safely**
   - Start:
     [Load first snapshot safely](/quickstart/load-first-snapshot-safely)
   - Stop condition: invalid payloads fail with typed parse errors.

3. **Goal: Run controlled rollout**
   - Start:
     [Add deterministic ramp-up](/quickstart/add-deterministic-ramp-up)
   - Stop condition: same user gets stable rollout result across evaluations.

4. **Goal: Evaluate architecture fit for team adoption**
   - Start: [Product value and fit](/overview/product-value-fit)
   - Stop condition: you have a pilot scope and acceptance criteria.

5. **Goal: Plan migration from another flag system**
   - Start: [Adoption roadmap](/overview/adoption-roadmap)
   - Stop condition: baseline/candidate migration plan is documented.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- reading all theory pages before running one working example;
- adopting rollout without stable identifiers;
- enabling remote config before boundary failure handling is in place.
