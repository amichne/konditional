# First success map

Use this map to reach one production-safe outcome with typed declaration,
deterministic rollout assignment, and boundary-safe snapshot ingestion.

## Read this page when

- You want a minimal path to first value.
- You need the sequence before opening quickstart pages.
- You want one cohesive implementation that is easy to verify.

## Step 1: define the first namespace feature

Declare one typed feature inside a namespace to establish compile-time contracts
for evaluation [CLM-PR01-04A].

## Step 2: add deterministic ramp-up

Add ramp-up behavior so stable identities remain in stable cohorts for the same
inputs [CLM-PR01-04A].

## Step 3: load snapshots through boundary-safe APIs

Load runtime configuration through typed result-based parsing so failures are
explicit and operationally safe [CLM-PR01-04A].

## Step 4: verify end-to-end

Run deterministic, boundary, and runtime-operation checks before rollout windows
[CLM-PR01-04A].

## Next steps

1. Execute the sequence in [Quickstart](/quickstart/).
2. Deepen rollout confidence in
   [Add deterministic ramp-up](/quickstart/add-deterministic-ramp-up).
3. Prepare broader rollout with [Adoption roadmap](/overview/adoption-roadmap).
