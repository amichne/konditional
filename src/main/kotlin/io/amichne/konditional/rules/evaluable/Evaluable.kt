 * Base abstraction for composable rule evaluation logic.
 *
 * This class provides the foundation for building composable rule evaluation systems.
 * Implementations can define custom matching criteria and specificity calculations that
 * can be composed together to create complex rule systems.
 *
 * The design enables composition through:
 * - Multiple Evaluable instances can be combined (e.g., [io.amichne.konditional.rules.Rule] composes [UserClientEvaluator] with extension logic)
 * - Specificity values can be summed to determine rule precedence
 * - Matching logic can be chained (all must match for composition to match)
 *
 * @param C The context type that this evaluable evaluates against
 *
 * @see io.amichne.konditional.rules.Rule
 * @see UserClientEvaluator
